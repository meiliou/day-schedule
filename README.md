# Day Planner
This is a simple day planner that allows the user to schedule events during a given day.
It allows the user to keep track of the event by showing whether the event is in the past, present or future through some conditional formatting. 
### Tools used
- HTML, javascript, CSS
- CDNs - JQuery, Bootstrap, Moment, Open Iconic
### Learnings
This was quite a frustrating exercise with many false starts. Trying to retrieve information from scratch was really difficult and I find I tend to overly complicate things for myself - I'm always wanting to create arrays and loop them when it's not necessary. I learned that sometimes its better to start afresh and that persistence is part of the game. I fixed a particularly frustrating persistence issue the next morning after spending 5 hours looking for the problem! Unfortunately it is currently deployed from the "develop" branch which is not best practice but I had previously deployed from main and my efforts thus far have not paid off. Will have to fix that in future.
