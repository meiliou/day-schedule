# Day Planner
This is a simple day planner that allows the user to schedule events during a given day.
It allows the user to keep track of the event by showing whether the event is in the past, present or future through some conditional formatting. 
### Tools used
- HTML, javascript, CSS
- CDNs - JQuery, Bootstrap, Moment, Open Iconic
### Learnings
This was quite a frustrating exercise with many false starts. Trying to retrieve information from scratch was really difficult and I find I tend to overly complicate things for myself - I'm always wanting to create arrays and loop them when it's not necessary. It was particularly frustrating when cosmetic changes to the html somehow broke the persistence of the data - a chief feature of the tool. I will need to come back and fix this.
